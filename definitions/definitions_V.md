## Virus
A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code.

### Polymorphic Virus
A polymorphic virus is a harmful, destructive or intrusive type of malware that can change or "morph," making it difficult to detect with antimalware programs.

### Metamorphic Virus
Metamorphic code is code that when run outputs a logically equivalent version of its own code under some interpretation. This is similar to a quine, except that a quine's source code is exactly equivalent to its own output. Metamorphic code also usually outputs machine code and not its own source code.

### Macro Virus
In computing terminology, a macro virus is a virus that is written in a macro language: a programming language which is embedded inside a software application (e.g., word processors and spreadsheet applications).

### Boot Sector Virus
A boot sector virus is a type of malware that infects a system's boot partition or the Master Boot Record (MBR) of a hard disk.
During startup and before security software can be executed, the virus executes malicious code.

## Virus Hoax
A computer virus hoax is a message warning the recipients of a non-existent computer virus threat.
The message is usually a chain e-mail that tells the recipients to forward it to everyone they know, but it can also be in the form of a pop-up window.

## Vulnerability
Vulnerabilities are flaws in a computer system that weaken the overall security of the device/system.
Vulnerabilities can be weaknesses in either the hardware itself, or the software that runs on the hardware.

## Vulnerability Assesment
A vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing (or ranking) the vulnerabilities in a system.
Examples of systems for which vulnerability assessments are performed include, but are not limited to, information technology systems, energy supply systems, water supply systems, transportation systems, and communication systems.
