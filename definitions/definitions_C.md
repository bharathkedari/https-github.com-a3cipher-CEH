## CIA Triad
Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.

### Confidentiality
Involves a set of rules or a promise usually executed through confidentiality agreements that limits access or places restrictions on certain types of information.

### Integrity
Means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle.

### Availability
For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed. This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system provides a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a free and open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities.

## Content Addressable Memory Table
Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table is a system memory construct used by Ethernet switch logic which stores information such as MAC addresses available on physical ports with their associated VLAN Parameters.

## Cookie
HTTP cookies (also called web cookies, Internet cookies, browser cookies, or simply cookies) are small blocks of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website and placed on the user's computer or other device by the user's web browser.

## Cross Site Request Forgery
Cross-site request forgery, also known as one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF (sometimes pronounced sea-surf) or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website or web application where unauthorized commands are submitted from a user that the web application trusts.

## Cross Site Scripting
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that can be found in some web applications.
XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

## Cyber Kill Chain
Developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain® framework is part of the Intelligence Driven Defense® model for identification and prevention of cyber intrusions activity.
The model identifies what the adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objective.
The chain:
- Reconnaissance
  - Harvesting email addresses, conference information, etc.
- Weaponization
  - Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload
- Delivery
  - Delivering weaponized bundle to the victim via email, web, USB, etc.
- Exploitation
  - Exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on victim's system
- Installation
  - Installing malware on the asset
- Command and control (C2)
  - Command channel for remote manipulation of victim
- Action on objectives
  - Intruders accomplish their goals

## Cyber Threat Intelligence
Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is knowledge, skills and experience-based information concerning the occurrence and assessment of both cyber and physical threats and threat actors that is intended to help mitigate potential attacks and harmful events occurring in cyberspace.

### Cyber threat intelligence - tactical
Technical intelligence (including Indicators of Compromise such as IP addresses, file names, or hashes) which can be used to assist in the identification of threat actors.

### Cyber threat intelligence - operational
Operational: details of the motivation or capabilities of threat actors, including their tools, techniques and procedures.

### Cyber threat intelligence - strategic
Strategic: intelligence about the overarching risks associated with cyber threats which can be used to drive high-level organizational strategy.
